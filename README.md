## C++ to Python Translator
### ***~~Work in Progress~~***
A seq2seq RNN that translates C++ code to Python code.

### ***Fundamental Problems***
1. Code has to be 100% correct in both syntax and logic to run. The approach of using end to end machine learning for code translation will not yield a performance that is satisfactory for this task.
2. More traditional rule-based methods that translate code is much more reliable, debuggable than using a recurrent neural network.
